Docker solved a real problem. Before it, keeping dev environments consistent was
a nightmare. You'd install some dependencies, maybe jot down a README, and hope
the next person could replicate your setup. Docker put it all in a container.
You wrote a Dockerfile, built an image, and ran it anywhere.

But Docker isn't a dev tool. It's a mediocre deployment tool vastly misused for
development. Docker hides the host, which is great for deployment---not so much
when you're writing code. Debugging becomes clunky. Editors struggle.
Dependencies are baked in (and into) layers. Everything takes longer than it
should.

Nix offers a better way. With dev shells (à la `nix-shell` and `nix develop`),
you write a simple config that defines your environment---the exact compiler
version, CLI tools, libraries, and even environment variables. Anyone who runs
it gets the same shell, same inputs, no containers, no fuss.

## The Dockerfile Mentality

I used to stick Docker into everything, because I thought it was the ultimate
solution to reproducible, consistent development and deployment. Here's what
development usually looks like with Docker:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.12
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ['python', 'main.py']
```

And then:

```bash
# First you have to build the app
$ docker build -t myapp .

# Then run it manually
$ docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app myapp
```

You're in. Kind of. But now your code editor isn't aware of this container, and
you can't use your usual tools unless you install them inside. You bind-mount
code, so you're halfway in, halfway out. You also don't know how deep you are,
unless you bind-mount the entire container. Yikes.

Switching projects means switching containers. Upgrading dependencies often
means rebuilding the image. It _does_ work, but it's clunky and
time-consuming---especially for day-to-day development. I never enjoyed
developing with Docker, let alone deploying.

## The Nix Shell Way

Nix introduces you to dedicated shells for your setups. Besides the possibility
of creating your shells from templates (that you can store on Git, or in your
system), dev shells are consistent, explicit and expressive ways of declaring
your environment as code. Let's look at a Nix2 [^1] example

[^1]: I will use Nix2 and Nix3 to refer to "legacy" nix commands such as
    `nix-shell` ("nix2") vs the new, less agreed upon nix commands such as
    `nix develop` ("nix3"). The schema for those generations of commands is not
    consistent, but as a general rule of thumb, Nix2 commands are separated with
    dashes, e.g., `nix-do-thing` while Nix3 leans into more into spaces for
    separation, for example: `nix do-thing`. These terms are documented in the
    official Nix manpages.

```nix
# shell.nix
{ pkgs ?
  import (builtins.fetchTarball {
    name = "nixos-release-24.11";
    url = "https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/archive/26d499fc9f1d567283d5d56fcf367edd815dba1d.tar.gz";
    sha256 = "1kj5i5k7jzr9ahm2hrb5bnf9dmv89grykgpw4r7zr645va854y8l";
  }) {}
}:

# Use mkShell to define a development environment
pkgs.mkShell {
  name = "python-dev";
  # List the packages needed for development
  packages = [
    pkgs.python312

    # Add Python libraries directly if desired, or use pip/poetry
    pkgs.python312Packages.requests

    # Add other development tools
    # pkgs.ruff
    # pkgs.mypy
  ];

  # Optional: Commands to run when the shell starts
  /*
    shellHook = ''
      echo "Entered Python 3.12 development shell."
      # Example: Install dependencies using poetry
      # if requirements are managed that way
      # if [ -f "pyproject.toml" ]; then
      #   poetry install --no-root
      # fi

      # One of the ways you can set an environment variable inside a dev shell.
      # A more idiomatic way to set those is using `env.VAR = "value";` inside
      # mkShell.
      export MY_DEV_VARIABLE="hello"
    '';
  */
}
```

This `mkShell` definition fetches a specific pinned version of Nixpkgs (ensuring
reproducibility) and makes Python 3.12 and the `requests` library available in
the shell environment. Alternatively, you can use `pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {}`
to quickly bootstrap a shell using your system's Nixpkgs channel, though this is
less reproducible unless the channel is pinned (e.g., via flakes).

You would be right to point out the lack of an ergonomic interface for pinning
in the legacy approach. In a sense, flakes solve this issue. With Nix3 (flakes),
the dev shell would move to a `flake.nix` and defined as follows:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  description = "Python Dev Shell";

  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-24.05";

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {
    devShells = {
      default = forAllSystems (system: let
          pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
        in pkgs.mkShell {
          name = "python-dev";
          packages = [
            pkgs.python312

            # Example: Include Poetry for dependency management
            pkgs.poetry
            pkgs.python312Packages.requests # Can still add packages directly
          ];

          # shellHook = ''
          #  echo "Entered Flake-based Python dev shell."
          #  poetry install --no-root
          # '';
        });
    };
  };
}
```

In this example, Nix fetches Nixpkgs when you `nix flake lock` and stores hashes
in a lockfile: `flake.lock`. This eases dependency tracking, and you can
_easily_ update your inputs with `nix flake update` when you need to.

With a Nix3 shell, you can run:

```sh
nix develop
```

And you are done. You're in a shell with Python 3.12 and Poetry, isolated from
your host, fully reproducible. No container, no image build, no port juggling.
Everything runs directly on your system---but safely, and reproducibly.

### Using Direnv, or; No Globals, No Surprises

Nix environments are defined top to bottom. If a tool is not available in
`pkgs`, called locally, or not declared manually then it is not available. You
have to be _explicit_ with where things come from. This means no accidental
`brew install`, no system-wide changes. Everything is pulled from the Nix store
in a way that is immutable, reproducible and reusable.

You can switch projects, and each gets its own shell, and that is specialized
tooling for each project as they are relevant.

Project A needs Python 3.8, Project B needs Python 3.12. What do you do, install
them globally? No! You declare relevant Python versions in the appropriate
shells. Python 3.8 here, Python 3.12 there.

Node 18 in one place, Node 20 in another. No conflicts, no virtualenvs, no
Dockerfiles. Awesome!

[Direnv](https://direnv.net/) is a tool that improves the dev shell experience.
Instead of manually running `nix-shell` or `nix develop` when you enter a
project directory, you can automate the process by using Direnv. It has a
specialized Nix implementation that lets you put `use nix` or `use flake` in
your `.envrc` to automatically initiate shells in trusted project directories.

### Editors Work Naturally

Docker isolates everything, including your editor. With Nix, your editor just
works.

Tools such as `direnv` also make this easier by allow you to load the dev shell
automatically when you `cd` into a project. Language servers pick up the right
compilers and tools. Autocomplete, linting, tests---all behave exactly like in
CI, because you're in the same environment. In fact, pull your own language
servers for all Nix is concerned! All useful LSPs are already packaged in
Nixpkgs, and you can avoid installing them globally or with a hacky tool like
mason.nvim in Neovim, which for reference, doesn't work on NixOS because it's
badly designed. No mounting code into containers. No syncing files. No remote
debugging. Just a real shell with real tools.

<Todo title="TODO: This section is incomplete" description="The information
  provided here is accurate, but incomplete. There are ways to approach service
  bootstrapping with Nix on Non-NixOS services.">

## Need Services? Bring Your Own

Sometimes you need more than a shell. A local database, a queue, maybe Redis...
Docker Compose is often reached for here.

While you _could_ still use Docker Compose alongside your Nix shell for these,
Nix offers integrated ways to manage services declaratively, keeping your entire
development setup consistent.

For NixOS users, system-level services can be defined directly in
`configuration.nix`. For managing user-level services or for non-NixOS systems,
[Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) allows defining
services (like PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.) within your user environment, often
activated alongside your project's dev shell. Though you must note that those
services would be running as Systemd **user services**, and it is not a good
idea to put them in your Home-Manager configuration.

Simpler scenarios might use process managers like `procman` or even just
background processes launched via the `shellHook` in your `mkShell` or
`flake.nix`. There are also community projects emerging specifically for
managing development services with Nix flakes, offering alternatives to Docker
Compose within the Nix ecosystem. The key is that you can define these services
using the same Nix expressions and pinning mechanisms used for your development
tools, ensuring the entire stack is reproducible.

## Onboarding Is Instant

To get started on a new project:

```sh
git clone ...
cd repo
nix develop # Or rely on direnv to load it automatically
```

That's it. No README instructions, no bash scripts, no local setup. Everything
is pinned in the flake. Everyone gets the same result, guaranteed. Your CI uses
the same flake. You test in the same environment you write in. No more "works on
my machine." It either builds or it doesn't.

## What About Docker Images?

Still need to ship a Docker image? Nix can build those too. Nixpkgs includes
`dockerTools` which allow you to build OCI images directly from Nix derivations.

```nix
# Example within a flake.nix or other Nix expression
let
  # Assume myPackage is a Nix derivation for your application
  myPackage = pkgs.callPackage ./package.nix { };
in
pkgs.dockerTools.buildImage {
  name = "myapp";
  tag = "latest";
  # Include your application derivation and any runtime dependencies
  contents = [ myPackage pkgs.bash ];
  config = {
    # Define the command to run when the container starts
    Cmd = [ "${myPackage}/bin/myapp" ];
    WorkingDir = "/";
    # Expose ports, set environment variables, etc.
    # ExposedPorts = { "8080/tcp" = {}; };
  };
}
```

No Dockerfile. No wrestling with layer caching. Just a reproducible image, built
by Nix, that behaves exactly like the dev shell it came from (assuming you
include the necessary runtime dependencies). But for many deployment scenarios
beyond simple containers (like deploying to VMs or bare metal), `nix build`
producing direct artifacts might be all you need.

## Conclusion

Docker gave developers a way to approximate consistency. Nix guarantees it.

Nix2 shells (`shell.nix`) have long been a way to define developer environments.
With flakes, you define _everything_: the shell, the dependencies, the runtime,
the build output. No layers, no mutation, no cleanup steps. It’s all explicit.
Version-controlled. Reproducible. If you're using Docker to manage dev
environments, you're doing more work than you need to. Switch to Nix. Keep your
tools native, your shell fast, and your setup honest.

This has been my thoughts on using Nix to replace Docker. I've switched, and I
have never found setting up developer environments easier. But let me hear your
thoughts. Shoot me an e-mail, hit me up on Matrix, or DM me on Discord. I'd love
to know what your experience has been like. Cheers!
